This is a ***Nextjs app***

You can find the working app in https://torre-test-new.vercel.app/



To run it: 

1)Clone this repo.
2)In your console run `npm i`.
3)After installing the dependencies, run `npm run dev`


Bugs: you need to install a cors extension so the app is able to make a get Request to the Torre api. Bug will be fixed soon.
